# Value and Reference Types

I think of reference types like pointers, everything points to the original object in memory

By Value means creating a COPY of the original. Picture it like twins: they are born exactly the same, but the first twin doesn’t lose a leg when the second twin loses his in the war.
By Reference means creating an ALIAS to the original. When your Mom calls you “Pumpkin Pie” although your name is Margaret, this doesn’t suddenly give birth to a clone of yourself: you are still one, but you can be called by these two very different names.

not my explanation
