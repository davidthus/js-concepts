# Coercion in JS

Value can be implicity or explicitly coerced (converted into another data type). You can coerce string, boolean and number primitive types.
You can also do this explicitly like this: Number("42") or String(42);
That is why there is a difference between == and === because the strict equals does not allow the value to coerce whereas the double equals does.
